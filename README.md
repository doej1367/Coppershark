A simple diagnostics tool to watch out for exceptions on the network connection and report them. 

This is a Minecraft 1.8.9 Forge Mod that reports every exception that occures on any connection to this [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jHmy76KQfY) including `server ip`, `uptime`, `error type` and a minimal version of a `traceroute` of the connection.
